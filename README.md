### Contributing
When contributing localizations make sure to base them off ``en_US.lang``. Keep the same structure (I will occasionally run a script to keep things up to date).
When contributing textures try to place them into directories that describe them well. Textures of hearts and armor would fit into a ``player`` directory. A clock texture might fit into a ``time`` folder.
